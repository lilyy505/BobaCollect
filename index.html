    <p><center>Tapioca Pearls: These are the chewy, round balls that are the hallmark of boba. <br>
Water: Used for cooking the tapioca pearls. <br>
Brown Sugar: Used to sweeten and caramelize the tapioca pearls. <br>
Taiwanese brown sugar is often used for a more authentic caramel flavor and faster melting. <br>
Regular brown sugar can also be used, but the boba may be slightly lighter in color. </center></p>
